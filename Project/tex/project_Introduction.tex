Character simulation is a complex problem.
Some solution exist for this problem that are very robust~\cite{Yin07,Coros09}.
For this work I will focus on implementing~\cite{2010-TOG-gbwc}.
This controller is supposed to model the character animation problem in a more general way.
I want to implement this controller again using some new features in BulletPhsyics~\cite{coumans2013bullet}.
The first new feature of interest is the Featherstone method for calculating articulated-body inertias~\cite{featherstone2014rigid}. 
The second feature is a new Mixed Linear Complementarity Problem solver. This solver does not have the performance of current solver in bullet but should converge to a stable solution faster.
