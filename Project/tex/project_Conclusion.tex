	\noindent \textbf{Was \bulletPhysics a good choice?}
	
	\bulletPhysics has been a great framework to use for this work. There are some design decisions I did not expect. However, I think the numerical stability and use of the \Featherstone algorithm are important advantages.

	\noindent \textbf{Different joint angle specification to help solve issues}
	
	I have found another method in \bulletPhysics to calculate relative joint angles that will hopefully help me eliminate some of the joint angle wrap around issues I have been having.
