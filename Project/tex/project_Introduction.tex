Physics-based character simulation is difficult due to the complexities in human motion.
Some solutions exist that animate characters very well and are very robust~\cite{Yin07,Coros09}.
For this work I will focus on implementing SIMBICON from~\cite{Yin07}.
SIMBICON uses a set of defined poses and a linear feedback model to simulate the walking gait of a biped.
I want to implement this controller using some new features in \bulletPhysics~\cite{coumans2013bullet}.
The first new feature of interest is the Featherstone method for calculating articulated-body inertias~\cite{featherstone2014rigid}. 
The second feature is a new Mixed Linear Complementarity Problem solver. %~\todocite{MLCP}. 
This solver does not have the performance of current solvers in \bulletPhysics but should converge to a stable solution faster.

	\item {Some solution exist for this problem that are very robust}
	\item {In particular "Generalized biped motion"}
	\item {This controller is supposed to model the character animation problem in a general way.}
	\item {I want to implement this controller again using some new features in \bulletPhysics}
